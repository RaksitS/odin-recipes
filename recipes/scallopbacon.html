	<h2>Direction</h2>

	<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>
	<p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add spaghetti and cook until tender, yet firm to bite, about 10 minutes, or to your desired preference. Drain well.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 2</b></h3>
	<p>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat, add bacon, and cook until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a paper towel, set aside, and leave bacon fat in skillet.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 3</b></h3>
	<p>Dry and lightly press scallops with a paper towel to remove moisture, and add to skillet. Sprinkle with garlic and red pepper flakes, and stir until scallops are tender, about 2 minutes.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 4</b></h3>
	<p>Add the spaghetti to the skillet, and toss until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

	<h3><b>Step 5</b></h3>
	<p>Crumble bacon into the pasta, sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.</p>
