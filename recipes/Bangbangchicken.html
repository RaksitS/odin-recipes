<h1>Bang Bang Chicken</h1>
<article>
<p>This bang bang chicken is a wonderful Americanized version of an extremely popular Sichuan Chinese dish. With twice-fried chicken, you get the crispy fried breading you'd expect, and the bang bang sauce drizzle makes the entire dish spectacular.</p>

	<h2>Direction</h2>

	<h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>
	<p>Whisk together milk and egg in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; stir to coat and allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Drain and discard egg mixture.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 2</b></h3>
	<p>Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and shichimi in a medium bowl. Pour into a large plastic resealable bag. Add chicken; seal the bag and shake until chicken is well coated.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 3</b></h3>
	<p>Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Working in batches of about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, cook chicken in hot oil for about 90 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate; keep each batch separate.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 4</b></h3>
	<p>Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry for another 90 seconds.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 5</b></h3>
	<p>Remove to another paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batches of chicken.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 6</b></h3>
	<p>Mix together mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang in a large serving bowl until combined.</p>
	
	<h3><b>Step 7</b></h3>
	<p>Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat. Serve and enjoy!</p>
